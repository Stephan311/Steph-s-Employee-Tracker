# Steph-s-Employee-Tracker

In this assignment, I created an employee tracker that allows companies to keep track of their employees, departments, and roles. I built a comprehensive node program that allows users to add employees, roles, and departments. The program also allows the user to view employees, roles, departments, and the entire company with neatly organized tables. One issue I had with developing this program was using JOINS to link the ID's of different sections together to achieve more usability than what the minimum requirements state.
